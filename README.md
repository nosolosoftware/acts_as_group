# Act_as_group

## Philosophy

This gem facilitates massive operations in a REST style. To this aim, when a massive operation is required, a new resource is created called `Group`, the goal of this model is two-fold: represents the resources which are going to be updaded/destroyed and by whom is performing the action.

For instance, let suppose that we have an array of Posts that need to be destroyed. The naive aproach would be sth like:

```
DELETE /posts/1
DELETE /posts/2
DELETE /posts/3
...
```

But when the number of posts is very large, this approach could hamper the overall performance of our application. However, this gem solves this issue first creating a group with the ids of these posts:

```
POST /posts/groups

ids=1,2,3,...&owner_id=myself
```

Then, after creating the group is possible to perform the very same operation in all the ids forming the group. For instance, let suppose that all the aforementioned posts need to be destroyed, this operation could be performed in a very straightforward way:

```
DELETE /posts/groups/:id_group
```

As the number of posts could be very large, the operation of destruction is performed in a background style. Similarly, if all these resources want to be updated:

```
PUT /posts/groups/:id_group

read=true
```

## Installation

Put this in your Gemfile:

```
gem 'act_as_group'
```

Run the installation generator with:

```
rails generate act_as_group:install
```

This will install the act_as_group initializer into `config/initializers/act_as_group.rb`.

## Configuration

All the configuration for this gem is contained into `config/initializers/act_as_group`.

* __orm__: enables to define which orm should be used to persist the `Group` model. Default: `cache`
* __background__: which backend should be used to perform the background processing. Default: `delayed_job`. Until the moment only sidekiq and delayed_job are supported.
* __destroy_resource__: which method should be called to destroy each one of the resources. Default: `destroy`
* __update_resource__: which method should be called to update each one of the resources. Default: `update`. It should be noted that it receives one argument with a hash.
* __authorize?__: its goal is two-fold. First, it authorizes the creation/update/destruction of the model `Group`. Second, it also authorizes the operation of update/destruction on each one of the resource. It is a `proc` executed in the context of your controller~s resource, thus it is possibles to access your defined varibles (such as `current_user`). This `proc` receives two arguments: the resource and the action perfomed on it.
* __model_name__: Model used as resources owner. Default `User`

## Routes

Use `act_as_group` in `routes.rb`

```ruby
resources :posts do
  act_as_group
end
```

to create the endpoints for group manipulation:

```
POST   /posts/groups
PUT    /posts/groups/:group_id
DELETE /posts/groups/:group_id
```

Additionally `only` and `except` options can be used:
```ruby
act_as_group only: %i[create update]
act_as_group except: %i[destroy]
```

## Callbacks

To use group callbacks in one resource, the model has to include `ActAsGroup::Callbacks`

Then four callbacks are available to use:
* after_successful_group_update
* after_successful_group_delete
* after_failed_group_update
* after_failed_group_delete

Each callback expect one or more list of symbols representing class methods,
and can also be called several times.

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include ActAsGroup::Callbacks

  after_successful_group_update :notify, :notify_admin
  after_failed_group_update :save_log
  after_successful_group_delete :send_mail
  after_failed_group_delete :reset_status
  after_failed_group_delete :another_method

  def self.notify(group, attributes)
  end

  def self.save_log(group, error_ids, attributes)
  end

  def self.send_mail(group)
  end

  def self.reset_status(group, error_ids)
  end
end
```

## Custom action methods per resource

To use a custom method in one resource for update or destroy actions, first the model has to include `ActAsGroup::Resource`

Then you can define the custom methods with `group_update` and `group_destroy` followed by a symbol with the method name of your model. It is possible to define only one or both.

Note that update method receives the attributes as argument, and destroy method does not have arguments.

These definitions have priority over methods defined with `update_resource` and `destroy_resource` inside ActAsGroup configuration.

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include ActAsGroup::Resource

  group_update :custom_update
  group_destroy :soft_destroy

  def custom_update(attributes)
    assign_attributes(attributes)
    save validate: false
  end

  def soft_destroy
    update(destroyed_at: Time.zone.now)
  end
end
```
