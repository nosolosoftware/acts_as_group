  # the behavior your are free to do it. You only have to declare a module such as
  # ActAsGroup::Orm::Custom with the methods `.find`, `.create` and `#save` and the call orm with
  # the name of the module demodulized
  # orm :custom

  # - Creation, update or destroy of the group document
  # - Operations on the original resources

  # you want to personalize which method should be used, it could be make by means of the following:
  # update_resource :set
  # In this case the behavior has been changed to use set, avoiding calling callbacks.

  # Removes the resource. By default it makes use of `destroy` on the document, if you want to
  # personalize the behavior, this method should be used.
  # destroy_resource :delete
